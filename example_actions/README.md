# Example custom actions

The files in these sections contain different examples of using custom actions.  These examples are intended to demonstrate some concept and will need to be modified some for your own environment.  As examples, error handling and such are not usually included.

Each folder has the following files: 
* a README that describes the custom action and how to use it
* a tse.js file with the custom action implemented.  
  
These files are designed to be used with the embed_template files, replacing the tse.js that comes in that folder with the custom action.  Alternatively, you can simply take the relevant components to create a larger application.
